Check that the version control system is integrated with the development environment.

### Set Up Continuous Integration System:
Verify that the continuous integration system automatically builds the code on every push.
Test the automated tests to verify the code.
Check that the continuous integration system is integrated with the development environment.

### Configure Notifications:
Test that notifications are sent to the appropriate team members.
Verify that notifications are sent for failed builds or tests.

### Set Up Monitoring System:
Verify that the monitoring system is integrated with the website.
Test that the monitoring system tracks website uptime, traffic, and error rates.
Test that the monitoring system tracks website security and sends alerts if there are any security issues.
