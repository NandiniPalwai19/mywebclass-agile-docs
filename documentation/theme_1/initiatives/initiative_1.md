## Test plan
The testing plan for implementing Google Analytics to track user behavior and gather data on website usage can be divided into three phases:

Integration testing: In this phase, the implementation of Google Analytics will be tested to ensure that the tracking code is correctly installed on all pages of the website, and data is being recorded accurately. This can be done by verifying that the Google Analytics dashboard shows real-time data and reports are being generated correctly.

User behavior testing: This phase involves testing how well Google Analytics is tracking user behavior on the website. This can be done by using tools such as Google Tag Assistant or Google Analytics Debugger to identify any issues with tracking, such as missing or incorrect data. Additionally, the behavior flow report in Google Analytics can be used to understand how users navigate through the website.

Analysis and reporting: The final phase involves analyzing the data collected by Google Analytics and creating reports to help make data-driven decisions. This can be done by setting up custom reports, analyzing user demographics and behavior, and tracking conversions and goals. The reports should be reviewed regularly to identify any trends or issues that need to be addressed.
