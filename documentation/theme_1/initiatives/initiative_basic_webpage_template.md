## Test plan
The testing plan for this initiative could include the following:

### Legal Requirements:
Test that the website meets all legal requirements, including GDPR and accessibility standards.
Verify that legal disclaimers and terms of use are clearly displayed and accessible to users.

### Technical Standards:
Perform w3c validation, Lighthouse, and GDPR Scanner to ensure the website meets all technical standards.
Test the website's load speed and responsiveness on different devices and browsers.

### User Needs:
Conduct user testing to gather feedback on the website's ease of use, navigation, and overall user experience.
Check that the website is indexed by search engines and can be found using relevant search terms.

### On-Page SEO:
Test the website's on-page SEO, including title tags, meta descriptions, and header tags.
Verify that the website includes relevant and high-quality content for users.

By conducting these tests, we can ensure that our basic web template meets legal requirements, technical standards, and user needs. This will help us establish a solid foundation for our web project, ensuring that it is accessible and easy to use for our community members.
