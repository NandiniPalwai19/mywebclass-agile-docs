# Theme 1.0: Project Setup
## Overview
Our objective is to establish a highly visible web presence using lean and agile principles to quickly and effectively
develop a strong foundation for our web project. By completing the initiatives outlined in this theme, we can establish a
solid foundation that ensures our web page meets our business requirements throughout the life of the project, setting
us up for long-term success.

## Test plan
The test plan for the Project Setup theme will depend on the specific initiatives and epics within each initiative. However, some general testing strategies could include:

Unit testing: Each component of the web page should be tested individually to ensure it functions as intended.

Integration testing: The different components of the web page should be tested together to ensure they integrate properly.

System testing: The entire web page should be tested as a system to ensure it meets the business requirements.

User acceptance testing: Users should be involved in testing to ensure the web page meets their needs and expectations.

Performance testing: The web page should be tested to ensure it can handle expected levels of traffic and usage.

Security testing: The web page should be tested to ensure it is secure and complies with GDPR privacy regulations.

Each initiative and epic within the Project Setup theme should have its own specific test plan, outlining the testing strategies and criteria for success. Testing should be conducted throughout the development process to ensure any issues are caught and addressed early on, rather than later in the development cycle.
