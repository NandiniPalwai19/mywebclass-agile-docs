Verify that the website is indexed by search engines and can be found using relevant search terms.

DevOps Process:
Test the version control system by creating, merging, and branching code changes.
Verify that the continuous integration system automatically builds and tests code on every push.
Monitor the website's performance and security using the established monitoring system and verify that appropriate notifications are sent for any issues.

Monitoring:
Verify that website analytics are set up correctly and are collecting relevant data.
