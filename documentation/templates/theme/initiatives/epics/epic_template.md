## Title of the Epic: Implement DevOps to Support Seamless Development Operations

### Description: This epic aims to implement a DevOps approach for seamless development operations, enabling developers to focus on coding and testing without worrying about deployment and infrastructure.

### Goals:

1. Implement a DevOps approach for continuous integration, deployment, and delivery.
2. Improve the quality of our products by automating build, test, and deployment pipelines.
3. Improve collaboration and communication among team members.
