### Description: 
This epic focuses on implementing automated testing and monitoring to improve the reliability and stability of the LMS.

### Goals:

1. Implement automated testing to ensure that code changes do not introduce new bugs.
2. Implement monitoring to detect and resolve issues in real-time.
3. Improve the reliability and stability of the LMS.

### User Stories:

1. "As a developer, I want to automatically run tests on my code changes to ensure that they do not introduce new bugs."
2. "As an operations team member, I want to monitor the performance and availability of the LMS in real-time to detect and resolve any issues."

### Dependencies: 
Availability of tools and resources for implementing automated testing and monitoring.

### Risks:

1. Difficulty in integrating automated testing and monitoring with the existing development and deployment processes.
2. Lack of expertise in implementing automated testing and monitoring.

### Mitigation Strategies:

1. Adequate training and support for development and operations teams.
2. Phased implementation of automated testing and monitoring to minimize disruption to the development and deployment processes.

### Estimated Effort: 
15 hours

### Business Value:
