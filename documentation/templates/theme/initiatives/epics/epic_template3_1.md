### Description: 
This epic focuses on integrating Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices to streamline the development and deployment process for the LMS.

### Goals:

1. Implement Continuous Integration (CI) practices to automate the build and testing process.
2. Implement Continuous Deployment (CD) practices to automate the deployment process.
3. Streamline the development and deployment process for the LMS.

### User Stories:

1. "As a developer, I want to automatically build and test my code changes whenever I push them to the repository."
2. "As an operations team member, I want to automatically deploy code changes to the production environment without manual intervention."

### Dependencies: 
Availability of tools and resources for implementing CI/CD practices.

### Risks:

1. Difficulty in integrating CI/CD practices with the existing development and deployment processes.
2. Lack of expertise in implementing CI/CD practices.

### Mitigation Strategies:

1. Adequate training and support for development and operations teams.
2. Phased implementation of CI/CD practices to minimize disruption to the development and deployment processes.

### Estimated Effort: 
20 hours

### Business Value: 
Improved development and deployment process for the LMS, resulting in increased efficiency and reliability.

### Priority: 
High
